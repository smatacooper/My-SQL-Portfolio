-- continuing to experiment with the country club dataset that includes tables for membership, facilities and bookings.  Below I used the case function to categorize facilities' maintenance costs as either cheap or expensive based on the monthly cost.
SELECT name, 
case when (monthlymaintenance > 100) then 'expensive'
else 'cheap'
end as cost
FROM cd.facilities

--This query pulls all members who joined on or after September 1, 2012.
SELECT memid, surname, firstname, joindate
FROM cd.members
WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01 00:00:01'
